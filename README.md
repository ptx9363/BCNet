# Low Shot Box Correction for Weakly Supervised Object Detection

This code repo is built on [faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch). 

The final camera-ready paper is now available at [IJCAI proceeding](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/125)


## Installation and Preparation

Firstly, clone the code

```
git clone https://github.com/ptx9363/BCNet.git
```

and then follow [faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch) 's preparation to install the environment and dependency. This repo's specific dependencies are shown below:
* Python 3.5.6
* Torch 0.4.1
* Torchvision 0.2.1
* Numpy 1.15.4

## Dataset
We use VOC2007 dataset in our most experiments. We have run weakly-supervised method, [OICR](https://github.com/ppengtang/oicr),  to provide pseudo bounding boxes for images in VOC2007. Some of our experiments are trained from weakly pre-trained models. In general, we provide all of pretrained models and generated labels here.

* VOC2007 dataset with pseudo labels, [data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15ZhFEOedbjR8Z05LBJJxOzdE9SL8vVIX)
* Pretrained models, [models](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YLpcGVKluahKMHK2pO0lng4mpVsdgTMC)
* Edge boxes proposals, [data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YvfLfsVb0pU-51pKtRikNQ_SR-B8plMV)

the final data folder should be placed like:

```
BCNet/data/pretrained_model
      data/VOCdevkit/VOC2007
      data/edge_boxes_data
```

## Train and Test
From now, we have provided train&test code for BCNet with multi-stage and image-level regularization. Just run:

```
./train_test_vgg16.sh
```

All of the model modules are avaiable now while more train&test scripts will be released soon.
